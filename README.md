# General Translation Libraries

This monorepo contains the libraries for General Translation, a next-generation translation platform for Next.js and React applications.

Get started with General Translation at [generaltranslation.com](https://generaltranslation.com)!

Full documentation, including guides, examples, and API references, can be found at [General Translation Docs](https://generaltranslation.com/docs).

## Features

### ‚öõÔ∏è Translate entire React components, not just strings

- A single opening and closing `<T>` component is all you need to translate an entire React component.
- No need for complex refactoring or messy function calls.

```tsx
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <T>
      <p>You can write any JSX as children of the {'<T>'} component.</p>
      <p>
        For example, you could write a <a href='/'>link</a> and have the text be
        translated in context.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>Even deeply nested components are translated in context.</p>
          <button>Click me!</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </T>
  );
}
```

### üß† AI-powered translations

- Translations are created in seconds.
- UI and HTML elements are translated in context by state of the art AI models.
- HTML content are re-arranged and customized according to the language.

### üîß Developer-friendly

- Setup is simple and can be done in minutes, no need for complex refactoring.
- Never have to worry about localization while coding, ever again.
- No more wasting time managing translation keys like `t('menu.header.title')`.
  - Just write everything in-line!
